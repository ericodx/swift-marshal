# Contributing to Swift Marshal

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Swift Marshal**.

Swift Marshal is an AST-based CLI that organizes the internal structure of Swift types.
It reorders members within type declarations, but does **not** format code, alter logic, or infer developer intent.

For an overview of the project goals and scope, see the [README](README.md).

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful, professional, and constructive in all interactions.
This project follows the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

---

## Technical Principles

Swift Marshal follows a strict set of technical principles:

- Reordering must be **deterministic and reproducible** — same config and same input always produce the same output
- `check` is **read-only** — it never modifies source files
- `fix` must produce output that **passes `check`** under the same configuration
- No members are **lost or duplicated** after reordering
- Member **positions (file, line) are accurate** in all reported violations
- Trivia and formatting are **preserved** for members that do not move
- **Zero external dependencies** beyond SwiftSyntax
- Full compatibility with **Swift 6 Strict Concurrency**
- Pipeline stages are **stateless pure transformations** — no shared mutable state between them

Changes that violate these principles will not be accepted, even if they pass tests.

## AI-Assisted Contributions

AI-assisted contributions are welcome.

When using tools such as GitHub Copilot or other LLMs:

- Treat AI as an **assistant**, not an authority
- Ensure all generated code follows the same standards as human-written code
- Do not introduce speculative or inferred behavior

Follow the same code review standards regardless of how the code was written.

---

## Pull Requests

All Pull Requests must:

- Follow the repository PR template
- Be focused on a single concern
- Reference an existing issue when applicable
- Respect the technical principles described above

AI-generated changes are reviewed under the same criteria as human-written code.

---

## Workflow

1. Open an issue describing the problem or proposal
2. Wait for maintainer feedback
3. Implement the change in a focused branch
4. Open a Pull Request referencing the issue

Unapproved structural changes may be closed without review.

## Testing

- Unit tests are mandatory for all new functionality
- Use `ModelFactories`, `SyntaxFactories`, and `ParsingHelpers` for building fixtures
- Use `FileHelpers` for any test that touches the filesystem
- Use `ProcessRunner` for end-to-end CLI tests
- Use `SnapshotHelpers` when testing output format
- Tests must prove **determinism** — same input always produces the same output
- Cover both the `check` and `fix` paths where the change affects either
- Target code coverage: **90%+**
